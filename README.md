# Description
This project involves using MongoDB and Express.js to create an API for a social network application where users can shares their thoughts, give reactions to their thoughts and create a friends list. Using Insomnia, the developer can use CRUD methods to post, get, update and delete users and thought to determine if the application is functioning accordingly. 

# Installation
To install this project, clone the repo onto your local device. Ensure MongoDB is installed on your device. Afterwards, use npm install to download the requires dependencies required to run this application. 

# Usage
To create a user, enter the appropriate fields into the body of Insomnia in a JSON format, and submit the information using a post route. Using the get route, you will be able to see the user you just created, along with the specific ID corresponding to the user. That ID can be used in the put/delete route to update or delete, respectively, the user if desired. The same principles applies for the thought routes.
